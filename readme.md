## Description

An app for creating short nonsense stories by multiple people. Each user writes a few sentences starting with a line of text written by another user, without seeing the whole story.  After everyone is finished, the full story is revealed. The app is an attempt to recreate an old children’s game where a paper is being passed with each participant writing a sentence and folding the paper, so no one can see what’s being written before the story is complete.

## Details for teaching team

Used two database tables beyond the user table one for storing finished stories and one for those that are not finished yet. The main challenge of the app was to display unfinished stories only at the relevant part and hide the rest. The app has all the CRUD elements, it's using user authentication and server side validation.
